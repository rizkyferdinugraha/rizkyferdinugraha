**Hey there, it's Ferdi!**

I'm Rizky Ferdi Nugraha, helping small businesses through web development.

I enjoy building websites and digital tools designed to simplify business processes, strengthen brand identity, and unlock new opportunities. For me, software is more than just codeâ€”it's a way to solve real problems through clean, intuitive, and adaptable interfaces.

In my projects, I use various open-source tools for their flexibility and proven approaches. This helps me explore practical solutions that can be applied directly to real-world needs.

Beyond programming, I actively follow emerging technologies, digital business trends, and product development strategies. Cross-disciplinary understanding plays an important role in creating solutions that are relevant, sustainable, and ready for real-world challenges.
